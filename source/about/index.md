My name is Luhaozhao. I'm a happy programmer, web developer. I live in Guangzhou City, China, where is famous of delicious food and Lingnan culture.

For a few years, I have written a lots of programming notes in my Evernote, which I learn from other blogs and websites. So I think it's my turn to share. If you get a little help from my blog, I will feel gratified.
